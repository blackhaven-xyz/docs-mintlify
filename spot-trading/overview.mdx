Blackhaven includes a fully on-chain decentralized exchange built on MegaETH, with a bonding mechanism built directly into the trading layer. Protocols capture Protocol-Owned Liquidity instead of renting it through emissions, while users get near zero slippage.

Powered by MegaETH’s real-time infrastructure, spot trading on Blackhaven delivers sub-millisecond execution and high throughput.

<Info>
  Blackhaven captures all volume and fees that would otherwise flow to external protocols by controlling both the liquidity layer and trading infrastructure. Deeper liquidity attracts more trading, more fees, and more value for the protocol.
