<img alt="Overview" src="/images/where liquidity be.png" />

Blackhaven is a reserve-backed treasury that solves the liquidity capture problem most chains face. User deposits are turned into permanent reserves that stay on MegaETH and power the ecosystem.

Users deposit assets and receive principal-protected notes or fixed-term bonds. The treasury deploys this capital into approved MegaETH protocols, shares returns with participants, and reinvests surplus to grow reserves.

The treasury also captures value through the Backing Arbitrage Module. When RBT trades above its backing value, the protocol sells RBT and adds the proceeds to reserves. When RBT trades below backing, it buys and burns RBT. Both actions increase backing per token.

## Core Objectives

Blackhaven is designed to achieve five core objectives that define its function within the MegaETH ecosystem:

| Objective                                    | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Accumulate Reserves**                      | Grow treasury assets through bonds, fees, forfeits, and ecosystem rewards.                                   |
| **Anchor Ecosystem Liquidity**               | Support and stabilize key MegaETH protocols by directing reserves into ecosystem pools.                      |
| **Enable Protocol-Owned Liquidity at Scale** | Provide bonding infrastructure that lets other protocols capture permanent liquidity instead of renting it.  |
| **Own the Trading Infrastructure**           | Control the full stack from deposits to execution, keeping fees, volume, and liquidity within the ecosystem. |
| **Become MegaETH's DAT Layer**               | Build a foundational, sustainable treasury backbone that powers MegaETH's long-term infrastructure.          |
