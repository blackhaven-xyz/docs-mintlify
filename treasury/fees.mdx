title: 'Fee Structure'
---

Blackhaven's fee structure creates a self-reinforcing flywheel that rewards both RBT and HVN holders.

### Revenue Sources

The treasury generates revenue from six primary sources:

1. **Yield from DeFi Strategies:** Returns from deploying HPN deposits into whitelisted MegaETH protocols
2. **Early Exit Fees:** Penalties from users who exit HPNs or bonds before maturity
3. **Backing Arbitrage Module (BAM):** Value captured when RBT trades above or below backing
4. **Sequencer Staking Rewards:** Yield from staking the treasury's MEGA holdings
5. **RBT Pool Trading Fees:** Fees from the RBT-USDM liquidity pool
6. **HVN Pool Trading Fees:** Fees from the HVN-USDM liquidity pool

### Fee Split and Bootstrap Period

To ensure the treasury has sufficient resources to build a strong foundation, there will be a bootstrap period following the launch of the HVN token.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bootstrap Period">
    100% of all net treasury revenue is directed to the protocol treasury to
    build Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) and fund operations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revenue Sharing Activation">
    After the bootstrap period, revenue sharing will be activated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ongoing Distribution">
    Fees from net treasury revenue will be allocated to sHVN holders in the form
    of buybacks, while a portion will continue to flow to the protocol treasury.
  </Step>
