RBT Notes are fixed-term lockup instruments issued as ERC-721 NFTs that let holders earn guaranteed yield by committing their RBT for a set period. Unlike liquid staking where rewards vary and capital can leave at any time, Notes offer a simple proposition: lock now, know your exact return, collect at maturity.

**Quick Steps:**

1. Choose your term
2. Deposit RBT into the contract
3. Receive an NFT representing your position
4. Your yield is calculated and locked in from day one
5. At maturity, burn the NFT and claim principal plus yield

### Early Exit

You can redeem before maturity, but it comes with two costs:

1. **Forfeited yield:** You receive zero yield regardless of how long you held
2. **Principal penalty:** Up to 10% of your deposit, scaling linearly with time remaining

The penalty decreases proportionally with time held. Exit at the start of your term and pay the full 10%. Exit halfway through and pay 5%. Exit near maturity and pay close to nothing.

<Info>
  Penalties flow back into the contract, funding future yields for holders who
  complete their terms.

### Yield Curve

Yield scales with term length, combining a base yield with a bonus that accelerates for longer commitments:

$$
\text{Yield}(t) = r_{\text{base}} \times \frac{t}{t_{\max}} + r_{\text{bonus}} \times \left(\frac{t}{t_{\max}}\right)^{2}
$$

| Parameter          | Value                |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| $t$                | Term length in weeks |
| $t_{\max}$         | 52 weeks             |
| $r_{\text{base}}$  | 19%                  |
| $r_{\text{bonus}}$ | 33%                  |

<Info>
  **Rewards Pool:** RBT Notes yield is funded by a capped rewards pool. When the
  pool is fully allocated, new Note deposits close until the pool refills.
  Deposits reopen as rewards flow back into the pool. First come, first serve.

**Rewards inflows:**

- Excess mints from bonds
- Forfeited yield (early exit from RBT Notes)
- Principal penalty (early exit from RBT Notes)
- Forfeited unvested RBT (early redemption from bonds)
