The Reserve-Backed Token (RBT) represents the underlying backing of the Blackhaven treasury. Its value is supported by on-chain reserves that grow through bond issuance, Haven Protected Note (HPN) forfeits, early redemptions, and treasury yields.

## How to Acquire RBT

Users receive RBT through:

- **Bonds** - Purchase bonds from the treasury
- **Redeeming Haven Protected Notes** - Redeem HPNs against RBT
- **Open Market** - Purchase RBT on the open market

As treasury inflows increase, additional RBT is issued proportionally to preserve the reserve ratio. All backing assets are held and managed by the Blackhaven treasury with full transparency and verifiable on-chain accountability.

## Utility

RBT can be used across the MegaETH DeFi ecosystem in various products and liquidity strategies, allowing users to engage with on-chain markets while maintaining alignment with Blackhaven's treasury growth.
