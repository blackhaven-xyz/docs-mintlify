Blackhaven's fee structure is designed to create a sustainable, self-reinforcing flywheel that rewards both RBT and HVN holders for their distinct contributions to the ecosystem.

## Revenue Sources

The Blackhaven treasury generates revenue from six primary sources:

1. **Yield from DeFi Strategies:** Returns generated from deploying HPN deposits into whitelisted MegaETH protocols.
2. **Early Exit Fees:** Penalties collected from users who exit HPNs or bonds before maturity.
3. **Premium Capture Module Fees (PCM):** Fees generated from arbitraging RBT when it trades above its backing.
4. **Sequencer Staking Rewards:** Yield earned from staking the treasury's MEGA holdings.
5. **Trading Fees from RBT Pool:** Fees generated from the RBT-USDM liquidity pool.
6. **Trading Fees from HVN Pool:** Fees generated from the HVN-USDM liquidity pool.

## Fee Split and Bootstrap Period

To ensure the treasury has sufficient resources to build a strong foundation, there will be a bootstrap period following the launch of the HVN token. During this period, 100% of all net treasury revenue will be directed to the protocol treasury to build Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) and fund operations. After the bootstrap period, revenue sharing will be activated.

<Note>
Fees from net treasury revenue will be allocated to sHVN holders in the form of buybacks, while a portion will continue to flow to the protocol treasury.
