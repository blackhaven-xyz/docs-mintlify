Blackhaven will launch HVN on Baseline Markets, a token market built around real, locked liquidity where the system handles price discovery and liquidity (not market makers). Baseline establishes an on-chain Baseline Value (BLV) that acts as a guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves for every token. Buyers get a protected, transparent entry from day one.

## How Baseline Works for HVN

- The BLV sets the lowest tradable price on-chain and rises with trading activity and liquidity depth
- Liquidity is autonomous and value-retentive, with no custom deals, private spreads, or silent extraction
- Capital-efficient, liquidation-free borrowing and leverage scales liquidity with demand, supporting deeper markets and fairer participation

## Why This Matters

- Clear downside definition at launch
- Liquidity that cannot be pulled by third parties
- Growth tied to real market activity rather than emissions

<Info>
By combining a guaranteed price floor (BLV) with capital-efficient borrowing and non-liquidatable leverage, Baseline automatically scales liquidity to support higher prices, deeper markets, and fairer participation. [Learn more in the Baseline Market Docs](https://docs.baseline.markets/).
