HVN is the governance token of Blackhaven. It gives holders direct influence over key parameters and strategic direction. Governance is fully on-chain and open to all HVN holders.

Contributors and core participants initiate proposals, while HVN holders vote to approve or reject them. This keeps decision-making efficient and informed while still reflecting the community's will.

## Governance Scope

Proposals may include adjustments to:

- Treasury composition, deployment strategy, and reserve parameters
- Reward distribution rates and emission schedules
- Approval or removal of MegaETH DeFi strategies
- Allocation of Blackhaven's staked MEGA within the Proximity Market

<Note>
  Each HVN token represents one vote. This keeps the process transparent,
  data-driven, and aligned with long-term ecosystem growth.
